This is a fork of [the Netlify + FaunaDB demo](https://github.com/netlify/fauna-one-click) done with React Hooks. In future I will refactor to use React Suspense but it hasnt been done yet

It is deployed here: https://hooks-suspense-faunadb-todo.netlify.com/

You can play with it by clicking this: <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sw-yx/hooks-suspense-faunadb-todo&stack=fauna"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg"></a>

to fork and deploy!
